## Exercise Categories

### 1. Basics
- **Calculator (functions/calculator.go)**: Practice with functions, basic types, and error handling
- **Collection Operations (control-flow/collection_operations.go)**: Work with slices and maps

### 2. Intermediate
- **Shapes (interfaces/shapes.go)**: Learn about interfaces and structs using geometric shapes

### 3. Advanced
- **Parallel Processing (concurrency/parallel_processing.go)**: Practice with goroutines, channels, and worker pools

## How to Use These Exercises

1. Start with the basics and progress to more advanced topics
2. Read the TODO comments in each file for specific instructions
3. Implement the missing functions and methods
4. Run the tests using `go run filename.go` to check your implementation
5. Try to solve the exercises without looking at solutions first

## Tips for Learning

1. **Read the Documentation**: Make use of the official Go documentation (https://golang.org/doc/)
2. **Experiment**: Don't be afraid to modify the exercises and experiment with different approaches
3. **Test Your Code**: Always test your implementations with different inputs
4. **Review Solutions**: After completing an exercise, compare your solution with others or reference implementations

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the exercise you want to work on
3. Read the comments and requirements in the file
4. Implement the missing functionality
5. Run the code to test your implementation

## Running the Exercises

To run any exercise, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
go run path/to/exercise/file.go
```

For example:
```bash
go run basics/functions/calculator.go
```
